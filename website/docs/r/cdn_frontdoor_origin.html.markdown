# azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin

Manages a Frontdoor Origin.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-frontdoor-profile"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_frontdoor_profile" "example" {
  name                = "example-profile"

  weight                         = 500

  private_link {
    request_message        = "Request access for Private Link Origin CDN Frontdoor"
    target_type            = "blob"

  }
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Frontdoor Origin. Possible values must be between 2 and 90 characters in length, begin with a letter or number, end with a letter or number and may contain only letters, numbers and hyphens. Changing this forces a new Frontdoor Origin to be created.

* `cdn_frontdoor_origin_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the Frontdoor Origin Group. Changing this forces a new Frontdoor Origin Group to be created.

* `host_name` - (Required) The address of the origin. Domain names, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses are supported. This should be unique across all Frontdoor Origins in a Frontdoor Endpoint.

* `cdn_frontdoor_origin_id` - (Optional) Resource ID.

* `health_probes_enabled` - (Optional) Are health probes enabled against origins defined under the origin group? Health probes can only be disabled if there is a single enabled origin in single enabled origin group. Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`.

* `certificate_name_check_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable certificate name check at origin level. Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

* `private_link` - (Optional) A `private_link` block as defined below.

->**NOTE:** A `private_link` field is only valid if the Frontdoor Profile is a `Premium_AzureFrontDoor` SKU and the Frontdoor Origins `certificate_name_check_enabled` field is set to `true`.

* `http_port` - (Optional) The value of the HTTP port. Must be between `1` and `65535`. Defaults to `80`.

* `https_port` - (Optional) The value of the HTTPS port. Must be between `1` and `65535`. Defaults to `443`.

* `origin_host_header` - (Optional) The host header value sent to the origin with each request. Possible values include an `IPv4` IP address, `IPv6` IP address or a valid `domain name`. If you leave field undefined, the request's hostname determines this value. Azure Frontdoor Origins, such as Web Apps, Blob Storage, and Cloud Services require this host header value to match the origin's hostname. This field's value overrides the host header defined in the Frontdoor Endpoint. For more information on how to properly set the origin host header value please see the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/origin?pivots=front-door-standard-premium#origin-host-header).

* `priority` - (Optional) Priority of origin in given origin group for load balancing. Higher priorities will not be used for load balancing if any lower priority origin is healthy. Must be between `1` and `5`(inclusive). Defaults to `1`.

* `weight` - (Optional) The weight of the origin in a given origin group for load balancing. Must be between `1` and `1000`. Defaults to `500`.

A `private_link` block supports the following:

!>**IMPORTANT:** The approval of the Private Link Endpoint is currently a manual step in this process. For more information please see the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/private-link).

!>**IMPORTANT:** Due to a bug in the service teams code, if you are attempting to destroy a `Private Link Endpoint` connection to a `azurerm_lb`(e.g. `Azure Load Balancer`) resource within your CDN Frontdoor Origin resource which requires you to standup your own `azurerm_private_link_service`. You **MUST** add a `depends_on` attribute to your `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile` which references the `azurerm_private_link_service`(e.g. `depends_on = [azurerm_private_link_service.example]`). If this step is skipped you will receive a `Private link service /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateLinkServices/{privateLinkService} cannot be deleted since it has N private endpoint connections. Please delete all private endpoint connections before deleting the private link service.` error.

* `request_message` - (Optional) The request message that will be submitted to the `private_link_target_id` when requesting the private link endpoint connection. Values must be between `1` and `140` characters in length. Defaults to `Access request for CDN Frontdoor Private Link Origin`.

* `target_type` - (Optional) `TBD` (`**NOTE:**` as of right now I know these are valid `blob`, `blob_secondary`, `web` or `sites`. This value is not valid for `Load Balancer` resources which you must stand up your own Private Link Service).

* `location` - (Required) The location of the private link resource, for performance reasons this value should match the location of the `private_link_target_id` resource.

* `private_link_target_id` - (Required) The resource ID of the Azure resource to connect to via the private link(e.g. `azurerm_storage_account.example.id`).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Frontdoor Origin.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Frontdoor Origin.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Frontdoor Origin.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Frontdoor Origin.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Frontdoor Origin.

## Import

Frontdoor Origins can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/profile1/originGroups/originGroup1/origins/origin1
```
